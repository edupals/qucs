Description: Quite Universal Circuit Simulator
 Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able to setup a circuit with a graphical user
 interface (GUI) and simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit. After that
 simulation has finished you can view the simulation results on a presentation page or window.
